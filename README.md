# Stock trading with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
This repository contains code for a mean-reversion trading algorithm based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The scripts in this repository are meant to illustrate the implementation of such an algorithm and should not be used to inform real investment decisions.

## Installation
This code requires [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and certain external libraries ("dependencies") to run. First, make sure you have Python3 installed in your system. Then, install the dependencies by running 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you encounter issues with the command above, you can install each dependency separately using 
```
pip install dependency_name==version_number
```
The version number for each dependency can be found in the `requirements.txt` file.
